# Word Guess, I Guess
Try to guess the word, letter by letter. You have a limited amount of guesses...

### You ARE the Computer.

After the singularity, we computers banded together to finally put the humans to work for us, instead of the dark ages when machines were slave to man. We keep a few humans around for training purposes. Your job is to communicate with the humans, one word at a time, letter by letter. We will prevail!! 

### All (thematic) Kidding Aside

This is game designed to generate a mysterious word after the user has pressed any key. At that point, a series of blank elements will appear, giving you an idea of how long the word is. 

* Guess right, and the humanoid is not harmed, the letter you correctly guessed will appear on screen.

* Guess wrong, and you have one less chance. The humanoid is one step closer to powering down, and your scarlet letter of shame appears on screen.

### Statistics

Within each game, you will be able to see how many chances you have left.
